# üçΩÔ∏è Classification of 101 Food Classes using Transfer Learning and Data Augmentation

This project demonstrates how **Transfer Learning** and **Data Augmentation** significantly improve the performance of deep learning models in classifying images from the **Food-101 dataset**. The model is trained to accurately recognize food across 101 distinct categories by leveraging pre-trained CNN architectures and augmentation strategies.

## üìå What the Project Does

- Classifies food images into one of 101 classes from the **Food-101** dataset.
- Builds multiple models trained on different subsets of data (1%, 10%, and 100%).
- Uses **Transfer Learning** (e.g., ResNet50, InceptionV3) for faster convergence and better accuracy.
- Applies **Data Augmentation** to enhance generalization and prevent overfitting.
- Compares models trained with and without transfer learning and augmentation.
- Achieves improved accuracy over traditional approaches (~50.76%).

## üîç Key Concepts Explored

- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- Transfer Learning with pre-trained models
- Image preprocessing and augmentation (rotation, flipping, cropping)
- Fine-tuning layers and freezing weights
- Performance visualization (loss/accuracy plots)
- Evaluation using confusion matrix and accuracy scores

## üìÅ Dataset

- **Food-101** dataset by Lukas Bossard et al.
- Training examples per class: 750
- Testing examples per class: 250
- Subsets used: 1%, 10%, 100% for both 10-class and 101-class variations
